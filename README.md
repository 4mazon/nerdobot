# nerdobot

IRC bot for #mv.nerd built with CoffeeScript + NodeJS

## Usage

As this is being written, `nerdobot` is not stable enough to be uploaded to external repositories, so you'll have to fetch it from GitHub (either the repository or `master` branch realization.) Edit `config.coffee` to setup your bot configuration.

```
$ npm install
$ coffee app.js
```

You can also install `nerdobot` globaly:

```
$ npm install -g
$ nerdobot
```

Once `nerdobot` is stable enough it will be available in NPM's repositories, so you'll be able to install it like this:

`$ npm install -g nerdobot`

## Developing

Just fork this repository and start hacking on your own copy. Preferably, make your own branch out of `develop` (this will be easier for everyone to maintain.) Once you're happy with the results, need comments, or just want to let us know, issue a [pull request](https://github.com/alvaro-cuesta/nerdobot/pull/new/develop).

If the code is good enough, we have no problems on accepting pull requests (and you'll be added to the appropriate contributors sections.) If there's something wrong, we'll let you know and guide you to fix it. I hope it's just not **TERRIBLY** wrong :)

We prefer [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) code but might pull JavaScript if it's good enough (or maybe migrate it to CoffeeScript.) Ask before doing any work, just in case.

### Plugins

Hacking plugins is even easier. You can either follow the same steps for contributing (if the plugin is worthwhile for everyone) or start your own repo (just for your plugin) and start hacking there.

In any case, we're not sure we'll maintain your plugin code if you fork off our repo. If the code falls behind the development code, it might even be pulled off to a `old_plugins` directory. We might maintain it if we feel it's worthwhile, and you can always maintain it yourself.

Plugins follow this structure:

```javascript
module.exports = function(bot) {
  /* your code here
   * 'bot' will be your bot instance
   *
   * see 'lib/irc.coffee' and 'lib/bot.coffee'
   * and other plugins for API/examples
   */
}
```

```coffee
module.export = (bot) ->
  # your code here
  # 'bot' will be your bot instance
  #
  # see 'lib/irc.coffee' and 'lib/bot.coffee'
  # and other plugins for API/examples
```
